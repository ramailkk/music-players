## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install MPV

1.  **Download MPV for Windows** from the official source: [Download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/).
2.  **Extract the archive** to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., `C:\Program Files\mpv`).
3.  **Add the folder containing `mpv.exe`** to your system‚Äôs `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run `mpv` from any terminal.

### 2. Install yt-dlp

1.  **Download `yt-dlp.exe`** from the [latest release page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest).
2.  **Place the executable** in a dedicated folder (e.g., `C:\Tools`).
3.  **Add that folder to your system‚Äôs `PATH`** as well.

### 3. Verify Installation

To confirm that both `mpv` and `yt-dlp` are correctly installed and accessible from your `PATH`, open a new PowerShell terminal and run:

```bash
mpv --version
yt-dlp --version```

If both commands return a version number, you are ready to go!

##  How to Run

1.  **Open PowerShell**: Launch a new PowerShell terminal.
2.  **Navigate to the script's directory**:
    ```powershell
    cd path\to\cli-music-player
    ```
3.  **Run the script**:
    ```powershell
    .\music_player.ps1
    ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error message like `running scripts is disabled on this system`, you need to change the execution policy for your user account. Run this command once in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This command allows locally created scripts to run. You can now try running the script again.

Enjoy your music! üéµ
